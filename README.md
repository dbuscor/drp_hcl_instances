# DRP-HCL instances

Instances of the drayage routing problem with heterogeneous fleet, compatibility constraints, and truck load configurations (DRP-HCL; Bustos-Coral and Costa, 2022). The instances involving only standard trucks were introduced in the referred paper. The instances involving both standard trucks and longer combination vehicles (LCVs) will be introduced in an upcoming paper.
